# PBKDF2 to bcrypt Migration - Completed

## Migration Summary

Successfully completed full migration from PBKDF2 to bcrypt password hashing for the Lamer News application.

## Files Modified

### Core Application Files
- **`Gemfile`**: Added `bcrypt` gem, removed `ruby-hmac` dependency
- **`app_config.rb`**: Replaced `PBKDF2Iterations` with `BCryptCost` (set to 12)
- **`app.rb`**: 
  - Updated `hash_password()` function to use bcrypt
  - Modified `check_user_credentials()` to handle bcrypt hashes and reject legacy PBKDF2 hashes
  - Updated `create_user()` to use new password hashing
  - Improved login error message for existing users
- **`README.md`**: Updated password documentation to reflect bcrypt usage

### New Files Created
- **`spec/bcrypt_spec.rb`**: Comprehensive tests for bcrypt functionality
- **`docs/migration_notice.md`**: Documentation explaining the migration for users and admins
- **`scripts/migrate_passwords.rb`**: Administrative script to check migration status

### Files Removed
- **`pbkdf2.rb`**: Custom PBKDF2 implementation (no longer needed)
- **`spec/pbkdf2_spec.rb`**: PBKDF2 tests (no longer relevant)

## Security Improvements

### Before (PBKDF2)
- 1,000 iterations (low by modern standards)
- HMAC-SHA1 (adequate but not ideal)
- Manual salt generation and management
- Custom implementation (potential for bugs)

### After (bcrypt)
- Cost factor 12 (equivalent to ~4,000 iterations, easily adjustable)
- Built-in salt generation and management
- Industry-standard, battle-tested algorithm
- Memory-hard function (more resistant to hardware attacks)
- Automatic future-proofing through cost factor adjustment

## Impact on Existing Users

- **New users**: Automatically get bcrypt passwords
- **Existing users**: Must reset their passwords to log in again
- **Password changes**: Existing users who reset passwords get upgraded to bcrypt
- **Login attempts**: Legacy users see helpful error message directing them to password reset

## Administrative Tools

Run the migration script to check status:
```bash
ruby scripts/migrate_passwords.rb
```

This provides:
1. Count of users by password type (bcrypt vs legacy)
2. List of users who need password resets
3. Migration documentation

## Testing

New test suite in `spec/bcrypt_spec.rb` covers:
- Password hashing functionality
- bcrypt parameter validation
- User authentication with new system
- Rejection of legacy password hashes
- Edge cases and error conditions

## Deployment Checklist

âœ… **Before deployment:**
- Install bcrypt gem: `bundle install`
- Review configuration in `app_config.rb`
- Run tests: `bundle exec rspec spec/bcrypt_spec.rb`

âœ… **After deployment:**
- Run `ruby scripts/migrate_passwords.rb` to check status
- Notify users about password reset requirement
- Monitor for user issues and provide support

âœ… **Long-term:**
- Consider increasing bcrypt cost factor as hardware improves
- Monitor login patterns and user feedback
- Remove legacy migration code after sufficient time

## Rollback Plan

If rollback is needed:
1. Restore `pbkdf2.rb` and `ruby-hmac` dependency
2. Revert `app.rb` changes to original PBKDF2 implementation
3. Users with bcrypt passwords will need to reset (same issue in reverse)

## Security Notes

- This migration significantly improves password security
- bcrypt is more resistant to brute force and hardware attacks
- Cost factor can be increased over time as hardware improves
- All new passwords are automatically salted and secured with bcrypt
